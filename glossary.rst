    application property
        Application properties can be used to configure Nice. They are simple key, value pairs and look like this:

        .. code::

            my.property=configuration value

        The chapter :ref:`app-properties-in-openshift` describes how to set parameters in OpenShift. Alternatively, a
        property can be changed for a customer by adjusting the ``application.properties`` file. See next paragraph.

        While developing, you can edit the application.properties in the Nice Git repository located at
        ``customer/${CUSTOMER}/etc/application.properties``. If you don't want to commit the changes you can create
        an ``application.local.properties`` in the same directory. Settings made the the *local* properties file
        override the settings in the regular properties file.

    JFrog's Artifactory
    Artifactory
        Tocco hosts its own JFrog's Artifactory, a Maven software repository. During build, all artifacts are fetched
        from there. Either, the package is uploaded to the artifact directly or a :term:`Remote Repository` can be
        configured.

        Our Artifactory can be found at https://mvn.tocco.ch.

    continuous delivery
    CD
        Continuous delivery is used to deploy our Nice installations.

        Our CD is powered by TeamCity and can be found at https://tc.tocco.ch.

    container
        A :term:`docker image` running in a :term:`pod`.

        Configuration is part of the :term:`deployment config`.

    DB refactoring
        In the context of Nice, the DB migration in generally referred to as DB refactoring.

    deployment config
    DC
        The deployment config describes the containers associated with it. This includes image sources, resource limits,
        open ports, roll out strategy, triggers, etc.

         Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) dc …``.

    docker image
        An image that contains an application and all run-time dependencies except the OS.

    exposed port
        Port that is made available to other pods or services.

        This is configured in the :term:`deployment config`.

    image stream
    IS
        Describes a docker repository. Pushing a docker image to it can be used to trigger an automatic deployment.

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) is …``.

    image stream tag
        Describes a docker image tag. Defaults to ``latest``.

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) imagestreamtag …``.

    Nginx
       `Nginx`_ is the web server used for as reverse proxy in front of Nice.

        Nginx is running in the same :term:`pod` as Nice.

        .. _Nginx: https://nginx.org/en/

    persistent volume claim
    PVC
        A persistent volume that can be mounted into one or more containers.

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) pvc …``.

    pod
    PO
        A pod is one instance of the containers described in its :term:`deployment config`.

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) pod …``.

    pre-hook pod
        A pre-hook pod is a :term:`pod` that is executed during rollout, before executing the actual pod. In our setup,
        it is used for :term:`DB refactoring` and some startup checks. For more details, see
        `Pod-based Lifecycle Hook`_ in the OpenShift documentation.

        .. _Pod-based Lifecycle Hook: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#pod-based-lifecycle-hook

    Remote Repository
        In :term:`Artifactory`, Remote Repositories can be configured. For such repositories, Artifactory will forward
        requests to the configured upstream repository and cache the result for later use.

        Remote Repositories can be configured in **Admin** → **Remote**.

    service
    SVC
        Used to make a service available in the network. It provides a DNS name for a service in a way that hides the
        fact that the service may be provided by several pods (multiple replicas).

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) svc …``.

    Solr
        Solr is a search engine, Nice uses it to provide full-text search.

        Every Nice installation runs exactly one Solr :term:`pod`.

    route
        Provides a route to a service. This is used to make a service reachable via internet.

        Accessible via ``oc (get|describe|edit|…) route …``.

    wkhtmltopdf
        A command line tool for converting HTML into PDF. Within Nice it is used to generate PDF reports.

        The `wkhtmltopdf-binary`_ wrapper is used to be able to call the tool from within Java.
