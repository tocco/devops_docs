Entity class generation
=======================

Introduction
------------
All entities in nice2 are currently defined by \*.xml files, which are then parsed
into an :java:ref:`EntityModel<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.model.EntityModel>` instance.

There are two different :java:extdoc:`EntityMode<org.hibernate.EntityMode>` in hibernate:

- POJO (a different class per entity)
- MAP (entities based on maps)

As the two modes cannot be mixed and we would like to be able to use typed entities (instead of just the
:java:ref:`Entity<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.entity.Entity>` interface) in the future we need to dynamically generate classes for the entity models.

The `javassist <http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/>`_ library is used to generate the classes. The same
library is used by  Hibernate 5.2.x itself to generate proxy classes. Bytebuddy (http://bytebuddy.net/) would
be a more modern alternative, but the newest version is much `slower <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45456076/bytebuddy-performance-in-hibernate>`_ than javassist.

Class generation
----------------
The classes are generated during startup by the :java:ref:`JavassistEntityPojoFactory<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.JavassistEntityPojoFactory>`.
At first an 'empty' class is generated for each entity model, so that they can already be referenced by other classes.

All generated entity classes inherit from the same base class (:java:ref:`AbstractPojoEntity<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.AbstractPojoEntity>`),
which implements all of the logic required by the :java:ref:`Entity<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.entity.Entity>`
interface.

The generated classes contain the following:

- a private field of the corresponding type for each field and relation
- a getter and setter for each field
- JPA annotations, which define the hibernate data model, on the getter methods

If the annotations are placed on the getters (instead of the field), hibernate uses the getters and setters to
access the fields.

   Why did we switch to annotations on methods instead of fields?

Transient entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are so called 'session-only' entities in nice2 which are not mapped to the database (used only for data binding and the like).
A different base class (:java:ref:`AbstractSessionOnlyEntity<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.AbstractSessionOnlyEntity>`)
is used for those entities and no JPA annotations are added.
They are basically normal java beans that implement the :java:ref:`Entity<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.entity.Entity>` interface.
If such an entity is used in an association with a normal entity, no JPA annotations may be used on both sides, only
a normal field (or collection) is created.

Entities
^^^^^^^^

Apart from the usual :java:extdoc:`Entity<javax.persistence.Entity>` annotation, the database table name is
explicitly defined with the :java:extdoc:`Table<javax.persistence.Table>` annotation (we need to use the same
naming strategy to be compatible with existing databases).
A custom :java:extdoc:`EntityPersister<org.hibernate.persister.entity.EntityPersister>` is defined as well.

Fields
^^^^^^

All fields are annotated with the :java:extdoc:`Column<javax.persistence.Column>` annotation to define the
column name of this field (we need to use the same naming strategy to be compatible with existing databases).

**Primary Key**

The primary key must be annotated with :java:extdoc:`Id<javax.persistence.Id>`. If the key value is generated
by the database the annotation :java:extdoc:`GeneratedValue<javax.persistence.GeneratedValue>` is required as well.
For autoincrement columns, the correct strategy is ``IDENTITY``.

**Version**

Fields of type version are annotated with :java:extdoc:`Version<javax.persistence.Version>`, which enables optimistic
locking for this entity.

**Text fields**

**Custom user types**

**Other fields**

The ``nullable``, ``unique`` and if applicable ``precision`` and ``scale`` properties are set on the :java:extdoc:`Column<javax.persistence.Column>` annotation.
These properties are only used for schema generation in test cases (databases are setup by liquibase), not for
validation!
The type ``decimal`` (without precision and scale) is handled specially, because Hibernate would use a default
precision and scale, but in this case we want to use the column type ``decimal`` without any precision or scale.

Generated fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to define custom data types whose values are automatically set when an entity is saved or updated.
These fields are annotated either with the :java:ref:`AlwaysGeneratedValue<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.generator.AlwaysGeneratedValue>`
for fields which should be updated on create and update or the :java:ref:`InsertGeneratedValue<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.hibernate.pojo.generator.InsertGeneratedValue>`
for fields which should only be updated when the entity is created.

Associations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Associations (relations) are annotated with one of the following JPA annotations (depending on the type):

- :java:extdoc:`OneToMany<javax.persistence.OneToMany>`
- :java:extdoc:`ManyToOne<javax.persistence.ManyToOne>`
- :java:extdoc:`ManyToMany<javax.persistence.ManyToMany>`

So far all associations are bi-directional (even if this does not always make sense).
In a ManyToOne/OneToMany association, the ManyToOne side is always the owning side. In a ManyToMany association,
the owning side needs to be explicitly specified (with the :java:extdoc:`JoinTable<javax.persistence.JoinTable>`
annotation).
The owning side is responsible for persisting the relationship - if a change is only done on the inverse side of
an association, it will not be persisted! For example in a ManyToMany association, entities must always be added
and removed from the owning side, otherwise the mapping table won't be updated.

For collections a :java:extdoc:`LinkedHashSet<java.util.LinkedHashSet>` is used, because we want :java:extdoc:`LinkedHashSet<java.util.Set>` semantics
(no duplicates), but need to iterate over the elements in the same order as they were inserted (to support sorting by the database).

All associations (including ManyToOne) are configured to be loaded lazily by specifying the :java:extdoc:`FetchType<javax.persistence.FetchType>`
on the annotation. Per default only to many associations are loaded lazily, that's why we need to explicitly configure
it for to one associations.

When a collection has been initialized it cannot be reloaded from the database (unless the entire object is reloaded).
However when a  :java:ref:`Relation<ch.tocco.nice2.persist.entity.Relation>` is resolved, the data should always be
loaded from the database (because this was the behaviour of the old persistence implementation).
To support this behaviour we use a custom collection type (:java:extdoc:`CollectionType<org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionType>`).

A custom :java:extdoc:`CollectionPersister<org.hibernate.persister.collection.CollectionPersister>` is also configured.
